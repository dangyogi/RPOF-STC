Section 1. :underline:`Members`.
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Executive Board of the Republican Party of Florida shall hereinafter
be referred to as the “Executive Board” and its members shall consist of the State Chairman, Vice
Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Secretary, Assistant Treasurer, State Finance Chairman,
all Congressional District Chairmen, the National Committeeman and the National
Committeewoman from Florida, Chairman of the County Chairman’s Caucus, Chairman of the
State Committeemen and Committeewomen’s Caucus, Chairman of the Appointee Caucus, and
the immediate past State Chairman of the Party, if said person remains in good standing.

Section 2. :underline:`Congressional District Chairman`.
---------------------------------------------------------------

The members of the State Committee
representing counties in each Congressional District shall caucus at the organizational meeting of
the State Committee and select a State Committeeman, State Committeewoman, or Chairman as
the candidate for Congressional District Chairman from their Congressional District. The
candidate thus selected shall be the caucus nominee for election of the Congressional District
Chairman from that Congressional District by the State Committee.

Wherever possible, a candidate must reside within the boundaries of the Congressional District
represented as Congressional District Chairman. If no state committee member resides within a
district, the State Committeeman, State Committeewoman, or Chairman from the intersected
county residing nearest the district will serve as the Congressional District Chairman. The district
caucus shall also select a candidate for an Alternate Congressional District Chairman to serve and
vote for the Congressional District Chairman in his or her absence.

In any county where more than one entire congressional district lies within the geographical
boundaries of that county, the Congressional District Chairman’s alternate need not be a member
of the State Committee but must be a member of the County Executive Committee. In a
congressional district where there is no alternate available, the Congressional District Chairman’s
Alternate is elected from a caucus consisting of the State Committeeman and State
Committeewoman and County Chairman from each county within the congressional district.

A Congressional District Chairman’s Alternate who is not a member of the State Committee may
assume the responsibilities of the Congressional District Chairman for a time not to exceed the
time set forth under Vacancies in Article V.

Except as provided above, the Congressional District Chairman must be a member of the State
Committee.

Section 3. :underline:`Authority`.
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Executive Board is vested with all rights of the State Committee
and is authorized to act fully and completely in its stead and on its behalf in all matters that may
be brought before it between meetings of the State Committee. Furthermore, the Executive Board
shall be considered a competent tribunal as specified in Section 103.131(7), Florida Statutes, for
the express purpose of considering any member or officer for removal by declaring void his or her
election or appointment. The Executive Board is fully empowered to take any actions appropriate
for censure or discipline of any officer or member for cause, including removal from office or
expulsion from the party, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Robert’s Rules of Order,
for a necessary finding of cause and determination of accountability while in session as a
competent tribunal. The Executive Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings and such minutes
shall be available to every member of the State Committee.

Section 4. :underline:`Meetings`.
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Executive Board shall hold at least four regular meetings each year
upon call of the State Chairman by ten days written notice. A special meeting of the Executive
Board may be called at any time by the State Chairman or shall be called upon written request of
a majority of the members of the Executive Board, which request shall state the purpose of the call
for a special meeting and the date, time, and location. The Secretary, upon receipt of a valid written
request, shall issue a call for a special meeting detailing the specific purpose for such meeting to
each member of the Executive Board with at least ten days’ written notice. A quorum for the
transaction of business at any regular or special meeting of the Executive Board shall consist of a
majority of the members of the Board, but a minority of those present at any regular or special
meeting, though less than a quorum, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting to a future time.
The vote required on any question coming before the Executive Board shall be a majority of the
quorum present. Proxy voting is not permissible at meetings of the Executive Board.

Section 5. :underline:`Party Rules`.
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Executive Board shall be responsible for adopting all Party Rules
that affect the operations of the Republican Party of Florida. All such rules shall be announced to
the State Committee at the next regular or special meeting of the State Committee and shall be
subject to change or deletion by the full Committee.
